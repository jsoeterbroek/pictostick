First-Time Use
==============

The first time you turn on the PictoStick, it will need to be configured to connect to your local WiFi network. This is a one-time setup process that allows the device to synchronize the correct time and date, which is crucial for displaying the daily schedules correctly.

1.  **Power On**: Press and hold the side power button (Button A) for about 6 seconds to turn the device on.
2.  **Enter WiFi Setup**: The device should automatically start in WiFi Configuration mode. If it doesn't, a caretaker can manually enter this mode.
3.  **Connect from Phone/Computer**: Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your phone or computer to the "pictodevice" WiFi network.
4.  **Configure**: Once connected, a configuration portal will appear in your web browser. Select your home WiFi network (SSID) and enter its password.

For a detailed walkthrough of this process, please see the :ref:`initial_setup` manual.

Charging the Device
===================

The PictoStick is powered by an internal rechargeable battery.

*   **To charge the device**, connect the provided USB-C cable to the port at the bottom of the device and plug the other end into a standard USB power adapter or a computer.
*   A **battery indicator** is visible in the top-right corner of the screen during normal operation, showing the current charge level.
*   A full charge will typically take 1-2 hours. To conserve power, the device screen will automatically turn off after a short period of inactivity. Press Button A to wake it up.
