.. note::
   **Intended Audience**
   This document is intended for PictoStick everyday users. It also
   holds relevant information for Caretakers, Health Professionals and
   Parents of users.

Introduction
============
This document will show you how to use your PictoStick. The device
is pre-configured to show you your activities for the entire week in the correct order.
Every activity is displayed on the screen with a picture (a "picto") and a short
description.

The Buttons
===========
The PictoStick has three buttons that you can use, as shown in the image below:

*   **Button A (Side Button)**: Use this to scroll **up** through your activities. This is also the main power button.
*   **Button B (Side Button)**: Use this to scroll **down** through your activities.
*   **Button C (Large M5 Button)**: Press this to mark an activity as **done**.

Waking Up the Device
====================
To save battery, the screen will automatically turn off after a few seconds. This is sleep mode.

*   **To wake the device up**: Briefly press **Button A**. The screen will light up, showing your current activity.

The Main Screen
===============
The screen shows you everything you need to know for your day.

*   **Your Name**: At the very top, you will see your name.
*   **Day and Time**: Below your name, the current day of the week and the time are displayed.
*   **Activity**: The main part of the screen shows your current activity, with a large picto on the left and a description on the right.
*   **Progress Dots**: The row of circles at the bottom shows your progress for the day. Each circle is one activity.
    *   An **orange** circle means the activity is not yet completed.
    *   A **green** circle means the activity has been marked as done.
*   **Battery Level**: The small battery icon in the top-right corner shows how much power is left.

Navigating Your Day
===================
You can look at all of your activities for the current day.

*   Press **Button B** to see the **next** activity.
*   Press **Button A** to go back to the **previous** activity.

The device automatically shows the correct list of activities for the current day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).

Marking an Activity as Done
===========================
When you finish an activity, you can mark it as complete.

*   Navigate to the activity you have finished.
*   Briefly press the large **M5 Button (Button C)**.
*   The progress dot for that activity at the bottom of the screen will turn from **orange** to **green**.

If you make a mistake, you can press Button C again to change the dot back to orange.

Powering Off Completely
=======================
You do not normally need to turn the PictoStick off completely. Sleep mode is usually best for saving power. However, if you need to turn it off entirely:

*   **To Power Off**: Press and hold **Button A** for about 6 seconds. The screen will go blank.
*   **To Power On**: Press and hold **Button A** again for 6 seconds.

.. note::
   When the device is off completely, it cannot show your activities. It's best to let it go to sleep on its own and wake it by pressing Button A when you need it.
