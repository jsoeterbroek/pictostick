The PictoStick has a hidden on-device menu for caretakers to adjust core settings without needing a computer.

Accessing the Configuration Menu
================================

To open the main configuration menu, press and hold **Button B** (the lower side button) for about 5 seconds while the device is on.

This will bring up a menu with several options. Use **Button A** and **Button B** to navigate up and down the list, and **Button C** (the large M5 button) to select an option.

Menu Options
============

WiFi Configuration
------------------
This option forces the device back into **WiFi Configuration Mode**. This is useful if you need to change the WiFi network the device is connected to (e.g., you've changed your home router).

See the :ref:`initial_setup` guide for details on this process.

Picto Sequence Update
---------------------
This is the most common mode you will use. Selecting this puts the device into **Web Administration Mode**, allowing you to manage the user's weekly activity schedule.

For a complete guide on this, see :ref:`managing_activities`.

Setup
-----
This opens a sub-menu for adjusting basic hardware settings.

*   **Time**: Manually adjust the hours, minutes, and seconds. Note: The time should sync automatically if WiFi is configured, so this is for offline adjustments.
*   **Brightness**: Change the screen brightness level.
*   **Buzzer**: Turn the internal buzzer on or off for audible alerts.
*   **Theme**: Cycle through different pre-set color themes for the display.

Use Button A and B to highlight a setting, and Button C to select and change it.

Normal Mode
-----------
Select this option to exit the configuration menu and return the device to its normal, everyday operating mode.
