# Session Summary: Starting Issue #21 - Activity List for the Whole Week

## Recap of Key Actions
This session is dedicated to beginning work on issue #21: "Activity list for the whole week".

## Current Status of Issue #21 (from todo.md)
- Currently, there is one activity list for one day, configured via `data/index.html` and saved in `data/data.json`.
- The goal is to refactor the code to support 7 activity lists, one for each day of the week.
- This will enable different activity lists for different days (e.g., 'chess playing' on Thursday afternoons, 'basketball' on Monday mornings).

## Next Steps
1.  Create the `data/data_week.json` file as a placeholder for the weekly activity data. This will be the first step before any code refactoring.

## Session Metrics

## Possible Improvements
