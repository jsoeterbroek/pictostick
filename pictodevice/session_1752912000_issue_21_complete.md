# Session Summary: Completing Issue #21 - Activity List for the Whole Week

## Recap of Key Actions
This session focused on completing issue #21: "Activity list for the whole week".

1.  **Initial Assessment**: Reviewed `todo.md` and existing files (`src/main.cpp`, `data/index.html`) to understand the current state and identify relevant areas for refactoring.
2.  **Endpoint Identification**: Used `search_file_content` to locate the `/get-config` and `/save-config` handlers, which were found in `src/system.cpp`.
3.  **System.cpp Analysis**: Discovered that `src/system.cpp` was already configured to use `data_week.json` and handle the `weekdays` structure for web server operations, significantly reducing the scope of refactoring needed there.
4.  **Device Display Logic Refinement**: Identified that the device display logic in `src/uimain.cpp` and the preference storage in `src/PSpref.cpp` needed to be updated to handle day-specific activities and their "done" statuses.
5.  **PSpref.h/PSpref.cpp Modification**: Modified `include/PSpref.h` and `src/PSpref.cpp` to update `set_pspref_activity_done` and `get_pspref_activity_done` functions to accept a `String dayName` parameter, allowing for unique keys for each day's activities (e.g., "ps_a_monday_0"). The `set_pspref_all_activity_undone()` function was also updated to iterate through all days of the week.
6.  **uimain.cpp Update**: Updated `src/uimain.cpp` to pass the `currentDay` to the `get_pspref_activity_done` and `set_pspref_activity_done` functions.
7.  **Compilation and Debugging**: Performed a compilation using `penv/bin/pio run`. An initial compilation error in `src/uimain.cpp` (missed `currentDay` parameter in one `get_pspref_activity_done` call) was identified and fixed.
8.  **Final Verification**: Successfully compiled the project after the fix, confirming all changes are syntactically correct.
9.  **Todo.md Update**: Marked issue #21 as completed in `todo.md`.

## Efficiency & Process
The process was efficient, with targeted searches and step-by-step modifications. The initial discovery that `system.cpp` already handled `data_week.json` was a pleasant surprise that streamlined the task. The self-correction loop with compilation after changes proved effective in catching and resolving the missed parameter update.

## Possible Improvements
- More thorough initial review of all relevant files before starting modifications could potentially prevent minor compilation errors, though the current iterative approach with compilation checks is robust.

## Observations
The project's modular structure and the existing `data_week.json` placeholder, along with the `index.html`'s readiness for weekly data, significantly aided the refactoring process. The `Preferences` library in ESP-IDF is flexible enough to accommodate the new key structure for day-specific activity statuses.
