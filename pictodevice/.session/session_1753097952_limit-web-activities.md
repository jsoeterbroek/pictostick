# Session Summary: Limit Web Activities

## Recap of Key Actions
This session focused on resolving issue #20 from the `todo.md` file.

1.  **Understood Task:** Read `todo.md` to identify the requirements for issue #20, which was to limit the number of activities in the web interface to 20.
2.  **Modified Web Interface:**
    *   Read `data/index.html` to analyze the existing structure.
    *   Injected JavaScript to enforce the 20-activity limit. This included adding a `checkActivityLimit` function that disables the drag-and-drop functionality for adding new activities when the limit is reached.
    *   Added a user-facing warning message that appears when the activity list is full.
3.  **Updated Todo List:** Modified `todo.md` to move issue #20 from the "Unchecked Items" to the "Completed Items" section.
