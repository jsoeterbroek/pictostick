# Session Summary: Reset All Activities Undone

## Recap of Key Actions
This session focused on implementing issue #16 from the `todo.md` file. The goal was to create a function, `set_pspref_all_activity_undone()`, to reset the 'done' status of all activities.

1.  **Analysis**: I started by reading `todo.md` to understand the task and then inspected `uimain.cpp` to see how the function was being called.
2.  **Implementation**:
    *   I added the function declaration to the main preferences header, `include/PSpref.h`.
    *   I implemented the function in `src/PSpref.cpp`, ensuring it loops through all possible activities (up to the maximum of 20) and sets their status to `false`.
    *   I added a forward declaration to `include/uimain.h` to make it accessible to the UI code.
3.  **Verification**: I compiled the project using `penv/bin/pio run` to ensure the changes were syntactically correct and didn't introduce any build errors.
4.  **Documentation**: Finally, I updated `todo.md` to mark issue #16 as completed.

## Session Metrics
- **Total Cost**: I do not have access to cost information.
- **Conversation Turns**: 13

## Efficiency & Process
The workflow was efficient. By first examining the related `PSpref.cpp` and `PSpref.h` files, I was able to implement the new function in a way that was consistent with the existing codebase. This pattern-matching approach is effective for maintaining code coherence.

## Possible Improvements
The process was smooth. No significant improvements to suggest for this particular task.

## Observations
The project's clear structure, with a dedicated `PSpref` module for managing preferences, made the task straightforward. The `GEMINI.md` instructions to compile after making changes are crucial for catching errors early.
