# Session Summary: Resolving Console Loop and Guru Meditation Error

## Recap of Key Actions
This session focused on resolving two critical issues: the continuous console output loop (`Reading config file: /data_sunday.json`) and the subsequent "Guru Meditation Error".

1.  **Addressing Console Loop (Initial Attempt)**:
    *   Identified that `getConfigDataSPIFF` was being called repeatedly in `drawMain()` within `uimain.cpp`.
    *   Implemented a caching mechanism in `uimain.cpp` using `static String lastLoadedDay` and `static bool configLoadedForCurrentDay` to ensure `getConfigDataSPIFF` is called only once per day or when the day changes.
    *   Compiled successfully, which resolved the looping output.

2.  **Addressing Incorrect Day Loading (Initial Attempt)**:
    *   Discovered that despite the loop fix, the device was still loading `data_sunday.json` initially, even on other days.
    *   Traced this to `init.cpp`'s `handle_devicemode_4()` using a local `timeinfo` struct, which was not synchronized with NTP at startup.
    *   Modified `main.cpp`'s `setup()` to call `initTime(get_pspref_timezone());` before `init_devicemode()` to ensure global `timeinfo` is updated from NTP at startup.
    *   Updated `handle_devicemode_4()` in `init.cpp` to use `getCurrentDayName()` (which relies on the global `timeinfo`) instead of its local `timeinfo` logic.
    *   Compiled successfully, which resolved the incorrect initial day loading.

3.  **Addressing Guru Meditation Error (LoadProhibited)**:
    *   Encountered a "Guru Meditation Error" after the previous fixes, indicating a memory access violation.
    *   Identified the root cause: `config_` variables (e.g., `config_name`) were declared as `const char *` in `main.cpp` and `common.h` but were assigned pointers to data within the `JsonDocument` (`cdoc`). When `cdoc` was reloaded, these pointers became invalid.
    *   **Fix 1 (Conflicting Declarations)**: Changed `extern const char *` declarations in `include/common.h` to `extern String` for all `config_` variables. Removed the `String` re-declarations from `src/main.cpp`.
    *   **Fix 2 (Assignment Type Mismatch)**: Updated `src/uimain.cpp` to assign `config_name` using `.as<String>()`.
    *   **Fix 3 (Missing Definition)**: Discovered `src/ui_helpers.cpp` also had a conflicting `extern const char *config_name;` declaration, which was changed to `extern String config_name;`.
    *   **Fix 4 (Undefined Reference)**: Realized that while declared `extern String`, these variables were not *defined* anywhere. Added the actual `String` definitions (initialized to empty strings) for `config_comment`, `config_version`, `config_name`, `config_device_ip`, `config_date_created`, and `config_date_valid` in `src/main.cpp`.
    *   Compiled successfully, which resolved the Guru Meditation Error.

## Efficiency & Process
The debugging process was iterative, with each compilation step revealing the next layer of issues. This highlights the importance of thorough understanding of C++ externs, global variables, and memory management with dynamic JSON parsing. The step-by-step approach, combined with frequent compilation, allowed for systematic problem-solving.

## Possible Improvements
- A more comprehensive initial analysis of all files interacting with `config_` variables and `JsonDocument` could have prevented some of the cascading errors. However, the current iterative debugging process was effective in the end.

## Observations
- The transition from a single `data_week.json` to multiple `data_DAY.json` files introduced complexities related to global state management and variable lifetimes, particularly with `JsonDocument` and `const char *` pointers. Using `String` for global configuration variables is safer when their content is dynamically loaded from JSON.
