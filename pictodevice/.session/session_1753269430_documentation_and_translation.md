# Session Summary: Documentation Overhaul and Translation

**Date:** 2025-07-22

## 1. Session Goals

The primary goal of this session was to comprehensively review, augment, and extend the project's documentation. A secondary goal was to prepare a full Dutch translation of the completed English documentation.

## 2. Key Actions and Outcomes

### Phase 1: English Documentation Enhancement

*   **Structural Review & Reorganization**: I analyzed the existing documentation in the `docs/` directory and proposed a more logical structure with clear sections for Users, Caretakers, and Developers. This involved creating new `.rst` files and restructuring the main `index.rst` toctree.
*   **Asset Consolidation**: All documentation images, which were previously scattered across multiple subdirectories, were moved into a single, centralized `docs/_static/images/` directory. All image references in the documentation were updated accordingly.
*   **Content Generation**: I wrote new, detailed content for all sections, populating previously empty files like `getting_started.rst` and the entire Developer's Guide. Existing content was revised to be more accurate and comprehensive, reflecting the latest project features like the weekly schedule.
*   **Dynamic Versioning**: To solve the issue of a hardcoded version number, I modified `docs/conf.py` to dynamically parse the version directly from the C++ header file `include/common.h`. This ensures the documentation version always stays in sync with the source code.

### Phase 2: Dutch Translation

*   **Internationalization Setup**: I used `sphinx-intl` to generate message catalogs (`.pot`) from the finalized English source files.
*   **Translation**: I created the Dutch `.po` files and translated all the English text strings into Dutch.
*   **Multi-language Build**: I successfully built the complete Dutch version of the HTML documentation, which is now located in `docs/_build/html/nl/`.

### Build System Improvements

*   **Dependency Management**: Solved an initial build failure by identifying that the `sphinx_rtd_dark_mode` theme was missing and that the build process needed to use the local `docs/venv` environment.
*   **Makefile Enhancement**: I significantly improved the `docs/Makefile` to make the build process more robust:
    *   It now correctly uses the Python interpreter from the project's virtual environment (`docs/venv`), making it independent of the system's global Python/Sphinx installation.
    *   I added new, specific targets (`latexpdf-en` and `latexpdf-nl`) to allow for the clean, separate generation of PDF documentation for both English and Dutch.

## 3. Final Status

The project now possesses a comprehensive, well-structured, and maintainable documentation suite in both English and Dutch. The build system is robust, automated, and correctly configured for multi-language outputs (HTML and PDF) and dynamic versioning. The final artifacts are located in `docs/_build/`.
