# Session Summary: Fixing Console Output Loop (Issue #21 Follow-up)

## Recap of Key Actions
This session addressed the continuous console output loop related to `deserializeJson OK` and `Reading config file: /data_sunday.json`.

1.  **Problem Identification**: Confirmed that `getConfigDataSPIFF` was being called repeatedly within `drawMain()` in `uimain.cpp`, which is part of the main `loop()` function.
2.  **Solution Implementation**: Implemented a caching mechanism in `uimain.cpp` to prevent redundant file reads:
    *   Introduced `static String lastLoadedDay` and `static bool configLoadedForCurrentDay` to track the last loaded day and whether the configuration for the current day has been loaded.
    *   Modified `drawMain()` to call `getConfigDataSPIFF` only if the `currentDay` has changed or if `configLoadedForCurrentDay` is `false`.
    *   Updated `lastLoadedDay` and set `configLoadedForCurrentDay` to `true` after a successful load.
3.  **Compilation**: Successfully compiled the project after these changes, confirming syntactic correctness.

## Session Metrics
- **Total Cost**: I do not have access to cost information.
- **Conversation Turns**: 7

## Efficiency & Process
The process was efficient in identifying and addressing the root cause of the console output loop. The solution directly targets the redundant file I/O, improving efficiency.

## Possible Improvements
- None at this stage.

## Observations
- The `loop()` function's continuous execution requires careful management of resource-intensive operations like file I/O to prevent performance issues and excessive logging.
