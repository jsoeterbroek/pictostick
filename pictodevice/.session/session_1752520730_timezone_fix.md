# Session Summary: Timezone Fix

**Date:** 2025-07-14
**Session ID:** `session_timezone_fix_1752520730.md`

## Recap of Key Actions

- **Objective:** Implement a fix for issue #18, allowing users to configure the device's timezone via the WiFiManager web portal.
- **Analysis:** Reviewed the `todo.md` file to understand the requirements and proposed a detailed implementation plan using POSIX timezone strings for robust DST handling.
- **Implementation:**
    1.  Modified `PSpref.h` and `PSpref.cpp` to add functions for storing and retrieving the timezone string from persistent storage.
    2.  Updated `uisetup.cpp` to add a custom parameter to the WiFiManager interface, allowing users to input their timezone.
    3.  The entered timezone is now saved to preferences upon successful WiFi configuration.
    4.  Removed the obsolete hardcoded global `timezone` variable from `main.cpp`.
- **Verification:** Compiled the code using `pio run` to ensure the changes were syntactically correct and didn't introduce any build errors. The compilation was successful.
- **Documentation:** Updated `todo.md` to move the completed issue to the "Completed Items" section.

## Session Metrics

- **Session Cost:** (Not available)

## Efficiency & Process

The session was highly efficient. We followed a clear plan:
1.  Define the solution in `todo.md`.
2.  Implement the changes across the necessary files (`PSpref`, `uisetup`, `main`).
3.  Verify with a compilation check.
4.  Update documentation.

This structured approach ensured all requirements were met systematically.

## Observations

- The use of a preferences helper (`PSpref`) made storing the new setting straightforward and consistent with existing code.
- Using POSIX strings is a solid, future-proof solution for time management on the ESP32.
